\textbf{Probability and BMI}. The following table uses data from the NHLBI teaching data set and displays the 
body mass index for 3,909 participants in the Framingham Heart Study with BMI measurements at the 
first two exams, in 1956 and in 1962.  

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc|c}
                      & \(BMI \leq 25\),   & \(BMI > 25\), & Total \\
                      & exam 2         & exam 2    &  \\
\hline
\(BMI \leq 25\), exam 1   & 1,492          & 278       & 1,770 \\
\(BMI > 25\),    exam 1   & 249            & 1,890     & 2,139 \\
\hline
Total                 & 1,741          & 2,168     & 3,909 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Assume a study participant has been randomly selected from this subset of 3,909 participants.

\begin{itemize}
\item Define A as the event that this participant has a high BMI at exam 1.
\item Define B as the event that this participant has a high BMI at exam 2.
\item Define C as the event that this participant has a low BMI at exam 2.\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of A?\\
A: \(P(A)=\frac{2139}{3909}=0.5472\)

\item What is the probability of B?\\
A: \(P(B)=\frac{2168}{3909}=0.5546\)
\item What is the probability of A and B?\\
A: \(P(A \cap B) = \frac{1890}{3909}=0.4835 \)
\item Are A and B independent?\\
A: No
\pagebreak
\item In a randomly selected participant, what is the probability that A and/or B occurs (namely, that the participant?s BMI is high during at least one of the first two exams)?\\
A: \(P(A \cup  B) = P(A)+P(B)- P(A \cap B)\)\\
\(P(A \cup  B) = 0.5472 + 0.5546 - 0.4835 = 0.6183\)

\item What is the probability that B occurs, given that A occurs?\\
A: \(P(B \mid A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}=\frac{0.4835}{0.5472}=0.8836\)
\item What is the probability that C occurs, given that A occurs?\\
A: \(P(C \mid A)=\frac{249}{2139}=0.1164\)

\textbf{Probability of age and smoking events.} The following table uses data from the NHLBI teaching data set using the 4,434 participants in the Framingham Heart Study who attended the exam in 1956. Below, we show a table that contains the probabilities that a study participant falls into one of the eight categories defined by all possible combinations of the age categories and smoking status at the first exam in 1956.  Recall that all study participants are between 30 and 70 years old.\\\\
\textbf{Define \(A\)} as the event that a randomly chosen study participant is a smoker at exam 1 in 1956.\\\\
\textbf{Define \(B\)} as the event that the person chosen is between 60 and 70 years old at exam 1.\\

\textbf{Diagnostic Testing}. Screening for prostate cancer in men is a controversial topic.  One of the most common screening mechanisms is the PSA test (prostate antigen test).  In a meta-analysis, Mistry and Cable (2003) report that the sensitivity of the PSA test is 72.1\% and the specificity is 93.2\%. In the United States, it is estimated that 16.1\% of men will have prostate cancer at some point in their life (America Cancer Society 2012).   Assume that the prevalence of prostate cancer among men ages 75 and older is 16.1\%. We examine the properties of the PSA screening test in men ages 75 and older, 
using the sensitivity and specificity values above.\\ 

\begin{quote}Sensitivity: \(P(T^+ \mid D^+) =0.721 \)\\
Specificity: \(P(T^- \mid D-) = 0.932\)\\
Prevalence: \(P(D^+)=0.161\)
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of a false negative test result?\\
A: \(P(T^- \mid D^+)=1- \(P(T^+ \mid D^+)= 1-0.721=0.279\)
\item What is the probability of a false positive result?\\
A: \(P(T^+ \mid D^-) = 1- \(P(T^- \mid D-) = 1-0.932= 0.068\)\)
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected man who is 75 years or older DOES NOT have prostate cancer, given that his PSA screening was positive?\\
A: \(NPV =1 - PPV= 1-P(D^+ \mid T^+)=1-\frac{P(D^+)P(T^+\mid D^+)}{P(D^+)P(T^+\mid D^+)+P(D^-)P(T \mid D^-)\)}\) \( =1- \frac{(0.161)(0.721)}{(0.161)(0.721) + (0.839)(0.068)}= 1-0.6705=0.3295\)\ 
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected man who is 75 years or older has prostate 
cancer, given that his PSA screening was negative?\\
\(P(D^+ \mid T^-)=\frac{P(D^+)P(T^- \mid D^+)}{P(D^+)P(T^- \mid D^+)+P(D^-)P(T^- \mid D^-)}=\frac{(0.279)(0.161)}{(0.279)(0.161)+(0.932)(0.839)}\) \(= 0.05 43\)

\textbf{Titanic Survival.} The following table describes the survival status of passengers on the Titanic, stratified by Passenger Class (First, Second, or Third), Sex/Age (Child, Women, or Man), and Survival Status. The Frequency column indicates the number of passengers in each stratum. (For example there were 4 1st class women passengers who did not survive and 140 1st class women passengers who did survive). These data were obtained from the website anesi.com and refers to British Parliamentary Papers, Shipping. Casualties (Loss of the Steamship "Titanic"), 1912. cmd 6352 Report of a Formal Investigation into the circumstances attending the foundering on the 15 th April 1912 of the British Steamship "Titanic" of Liverpool after striking ice in or near Latitude 41 46 N., Longitude 50 14 W., North Atlantic Ocean, whereby loss of life ensued (London; His Majesty?s Stationary Office, 1912) page 42.\\

\textbf{BMI and Cumulative Incidence}. The following table uses data from the NHLBI teaching data set and 
displays categories of body mass index (used in the previous homework assignment) for 4,415 
participants in the Framingham Heart Study attending an examination in 1956 with non-missing values 
for body mass index. For each body mass index category, the table displays the number of subjects 
who died (death=1) during follow-up and the total person-years of follow-up (timedeath) until death or 
the end of the follow-up period (24 years). Assume that all deaths and time of death were recorded 
among the 4415 participants.

\textbf{BMI and CHD Incidence.} Use Stata and the NHLBI data set to create a separate variable for \"underwt\" that equals 1 if a person's BMI was less than 18.5 and 0 if a person's BMI was \(\geq \) 18.5). To create the separate variables for each of the four categories of body mass index, use the BMI1 variable in the NHLBI dataset.  What is the incidence rate for developing CHD (anychd=1) during the 24-years of follow-up for participants in each of the body mass index categories? (Express your answers as #deaths/(1000 person-years))  Hint: Number of years a person was followed for CHD is recorded in the \"timechd\" variable in the NHLBI dataset.
